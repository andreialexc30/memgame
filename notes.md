OOP Memory Game
Game with memory cards (images) that players need to flip
Need a bar at the top of the viewport to display the score of the players
Multiplayer game with turns (P1 and P2)
Want new game button that reloads the page and starts the game with P1 being first
Upon game start there will be a 1 second where the cards will be flipped showing their image before getting flipped again and the player
has to start matching the cards
Keep track of score (1 set of cards matched = 20 points), every wrong guess removes 5 points from the score
When all cards are matched, display total score and switch to P2
When P2 is finished display both player scores and declare a winner
